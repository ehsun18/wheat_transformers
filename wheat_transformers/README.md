# Modeling wheat performance using Transformers

We are using Multivariate Time Series Transformer Framework of @gzerveas. 
Their [repo is here](https://github.com/gzerveas/mvts_transformer).

We will use it to train models to predict wheat performace measurements (volume, density, protein content, etc).
